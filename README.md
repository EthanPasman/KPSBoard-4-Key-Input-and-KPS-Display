# Keyboard Input Display
This input display tracks keys per second from the keys set.

Currently only supports 4 keys at a time, as is commonly used in video games, but I may add support for different numbers of keys at some point. In order to change the default keys, click on one of the key buttons with the mouse, and press a new key to be tracked.

This application currently only works on Windows OS due to implementation.
